# The Toolbox

The Toolbox is where I keep my too-small, half-baked, or incomplete ideas. Some of the things here may be broken or buggy, they may ignore edge cases, there may be _much_ better ways to do things. Anyway, if you're borrowing things from my toolbox, __use with caution__.

I've added a README to each section to explain what's in the folder and a vague description of how it works and why.

__Enjoy.__
